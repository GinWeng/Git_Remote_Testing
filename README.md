# Purpose of this project: {
 - This project is to improve & build upon the original project done in subject MCEN90028 Robotic Systems, in terms of the control methods (from original position control & velocity control -> MPC, and improve the mechanical design).
 - By doing so, author could benefit from reinforce the understanding in Git using, control theory hands-on experience, and CAD 3D design.
 - Now author is suffering from unable to find a degree relevant job (I am doing Master of Mechatronic Engineering) in the University of Melbourne for 6 years in total. Seeing fellow students have graduated & landed on decent engineer jobs while I am struggling to keep up with the study & below minimal wage DoorDash delivery job, it is suffocating. However, I won't let things bring me down again. I am trying to be a decent man that hoping to change the world for better, a person like Elon Musk. Let us see how far I could go.
